# Spring-Mass-System-Explicit-Integration-

Goal: Use a spring-mass system to simulate sheet (cloth) and volume (volumetric bunny). <br />
<br />

**Execution & Output**

Download the files and navigate to project repo and type the following in Terminal: <br />
./mass_spring 0    # for cloth case <br />
./mass_spring 1    # for bunny case <br />
<br />
The output will be a sequence of .poly files, which can be directly visualized by Houdini. A demo of my render can be found below!<br />
<br />

Look for bunny and cloth video under Simulations section.
