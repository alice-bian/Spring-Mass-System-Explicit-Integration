# Spring-Mass-System-Explicit-Integration-

Goal: Use a spring-mass system to simulate sheet (cloth) and volume (volumetric bunny). 


**Execution & Output
**
Download the files and navigate to project repo and type the following in Terminal:

./mass_spring 0    # for cloth case 

./mass_spring 1    # for bunny case

The output will be a sequence of .poly files, which can be directly visualized by Houdini. A demo of my render can be found below!

Look for bunny and cloth video under Simulations section.
